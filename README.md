# Utility-of-Synthetic-Data-in-Machine-learning-tasks.

n this repository, I tried to investigate the utility of synthetic data generated by DataSynthesizer and Synthetic Data Vault in machine learning tasks. I applied the Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Naive Bayes algorithms to the synthetic data and made a comparison. 

I used Adult (Census Income), Banknote Authentication, Iris, Social Network Ads, Titanic datasets. My main motivation was "On the Utility of Synthetic Data: An Empirical Evaluation on Machine Learning Tasks" paper by M.Hittmeir, A.Ekelhart and R.Mayer.
